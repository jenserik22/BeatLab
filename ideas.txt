1. Genre Style Packs

Example Packs:

Lo-Fi Chill Kit (soft kicks, vinyl noise, dusty snares)

Trap Kit (808 subs, sharp hats, snappy snares)

Boom Bap 90s Kit (crunchy drums, SP-1200 grit)

EDM House Kit (punchy kicks, white-noise snares)

Techno Kit (analog, deep, minimal hits)

Funk Kit (tight, dry drums)

Rock/Acoustic Kit (realistic multi-sampled sounds)

Latin / Afrobeat Kit (congas, shakers, claves)

Glitch Kit (weird stuff, SFX, metallic glitches)

2. “Style-Aware” Kits

Each kit can include:

default swing value

default velocity shape

808-style patterns

trap hat subdivisions
